<h1>General Course Overview</h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Many teachers<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=10859&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=byui_produ-104298" target="_self"> have</a> found it very useful to create a weekly podcast or video message to send to the students. This way you can keep them updated on assignments coming up and spend time answering class questions that the students have. Another way to <a href="http://google.com" target="_self">test</a>&nbsp;this is by recording the Office Hours sessions through Adobe Connect and sending the link to the students.</p>
<div>
<p>Here is a sample introductory email that you can send to the students. You may want to personalize it by introducing yourself to the class and adding information they may need to know about the upcoming semester. Download the document here.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://byui.brainhoney.com/Frame/Component/CoursePlayer?enrollmentid=34203604" target="_blank">Discussion Boards</a></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Each week in the course there is a Class Discussion board where students can teach one another by responding to a question that the instructor will post at the beginning of the week. The instructor will choose the question eachweek. It is important that you pick deep, thought provoking questions that will allow the students to think, and have meaningful conversations. The question should derive from the course content. Follow-up questions can be directed towards an individual or to the entire class to help the class break down the topic. Please read Asking Deep Questions to help you formulate your own deep question for each week.</p>
